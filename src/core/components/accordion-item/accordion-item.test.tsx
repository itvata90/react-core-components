        the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well
        as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our
        default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the{' '}
        <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
